# Vulkan Enabler Script "$Bash" For OneUI 7 
## why?
idk, people on [XDA Forums](https://xdaforums.com/t/how-to-activate-vulkan-on-galaxy-devices.4733096/) said to do so.

### this script is the bash version of the script on XDA.
To run this, just 
`chmod u+x activate_vulkan.sh` to make it executable
and then
`./activate_vulkan.sh`

> make sure adb is installed, part of android platform tools.
